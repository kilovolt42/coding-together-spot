# SPoT

This is my work on the SPoT project from Stanford University's [Coding Together](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/coding-together-developing/id593208016) course.

To run this code yourself you must obtain your own Flickr API key and set that key in the FlickrAPIKey macro found in SPoT/FlickrFetcher/FlickrAPIKey.h.
